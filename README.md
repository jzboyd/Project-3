# Project-3

By James & Joel

James: As someone who knows very little about crypto the thought behind this project was to give the user some basic information for the different types of cryptocurrency one would be able to purchase.

My responsibilities for this project were to construct the database using mongo atlas, and postman and also setting up the controllers and model for the backend.

One thing I would add to for the currencies would be to add links to their respective websites so one who wants more information can look into the crypto of choice. Another would be to add authentication and a comments section so users can contribute to the site.
*One thing I would not do is push to main. This error caused issues for the project on the night before it was due*
